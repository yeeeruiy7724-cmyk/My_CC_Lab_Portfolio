            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>The data in my project comes from my AutoSleep app, which I use on my Apple Watch to track my daily sleep duration, quality, and stages. The dataset I used to represents my sleep records from July 2025. Most days have complete data, except for a few nights when I forgot to wear my watch to bed or needed to charge it before sleeping. I selected the seven nights with the longest sleep durations (measured in minutes) as the basis for my Data Portrait.</p>
            <p>My design started from very basic in-class coding, using simple arrays. Each circle in my work represents one of those seven longest nights. The size of each circle corresponds to how long I slept that night, longer sleep means a bigger circle. I made circles to gently zoom, creating a subtle breathing effect, and I used the color palette that makes people feel comfortable. For the background, I chose a cute wallpaper from one of my favortite illustrators' work, the name of this little lamb is "SheepCat", I love SheepCat very much.</p>
            <p>Originally, wearing my Apple Watch to bed was just a way to monitor my health and sleep consistency. But when I turned this habit into data visualization, I found it meaningful to see my personal data transformed into something aesthetic and expressive!</p>
