            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>Recently, there are some new social memes on the Internet, among which Alien Cats is very popular, these alien cats are generated by netizens with many cat photos after the second creation, used for funny, comical social interaction, I want to create a funny face generator, like alien cats with fluorescent green all over their bodies, twisting on the screen.</p>
            <p>My initial idea was to transform the face size because it was the most intuitive face generator, and then I found out that it could also create a disco-like background, so I completed this face generator.</p>
