            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>I was browsing various 3D models. I am recently interested in the Chainmail Models. Some of these models look like dragon scale armor, and some are fish scale-shaped fabrics. Initially, I planned to make a simple fish scale shape in this assignment, so I wanted to start from the most basic grid loop coding. I filled the screen with circles drawn in a loop, and constantly adjust them to make them look like neatly arranged fish scales. Then I was using the "create your own palette" tool to randomly generate color combinations and apply them to these circles and background, but after studying the p5.js official reference, I found that the gradient effect is very suitable for creating Optical Illusions, so I changed it into HSB mode to draw the gradient effect.</p>
            <p>Moreover, I made a circle that can follow the mouse, adding a little bit fun; when exploring this part, I also combined it with the blendMode() I tried before, which is the same blend mode I use when painting in Procreate. The difference is that Procreate uses a brush or touch to set the color overlay effect, while p5 uses specific statements to trigger it. I tried them all one by one and finally chose DIFFERENT. I think the colors of this mode are the most exaggerated and strange. However, what’s more interesting is that I deleted the originally written blendMode (BLEND). I thought the original look was too ordinary, thus I wanted to see what will happen without it. After deleting it, I found that the whole canvas became very weird, which created a very ideal Illusions effect. This effect was like the hallucinations caused by eating poisonous mushrooms. I found it quite interesting, so I eventually changed the original name of the work from "Shiny Fish Scale" to "Magical Poisonous Mushroom"!</p>
