            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>Partners: Valentine Ye, Luke Wang, Iana Tchantchaleishvili</p>
            <p>Initial Design Process: Our collaborative process began with a simple exchange of Exquisite Corpse body parts. Each team member contributed one section: Iana provided the head design, Luke created the upper body part, and I designed the lower body part. My initial concept was an improvisational sketch of a cute little girl superhero. I imagined her lower body part wearing a short skirt paired with oversized combat boots. I wanted to kept my initial visual elements minimal, as I wanted to maintain a clean and simple aesthetic. </p>
            <P>Assembled Background Story: After receiving the body part drafts from my partners, I transformed them into the current artwork. I chose to name this piece "The Stitched Dream" because it embodies the essential characteristics of the Exquisite Corpse. This artistic method reflects the surrealist fascination with jumbled anatomy and random additions. The Exquisite Corpse tradition, which deeply influenced by the Black Dahlia murder case, has inspired countless artistic works exploring themes of bodies, human anatomy, surrealism, and the collage of disparate elements. The term "Exquisite Corpse" has become synonymous with concepts of stitching, abstraction, grotesque beauty, and mystery.To transform these concepts visually, I designed the background to pulse and shift like a dancing rainbow, representing the surrealist obsession with constantly flowing and merging dreams. The word "stitched" directly references the assembled state of the different body parts, where separate elements are combined together into one impossible yet cohesive being.</P>
            <p>Reflections: This project taught me that creative coding is an interesting yet humbling process. As a beginner in coding, I often find myself caught between ambitious visions and technical limitations. While I can imagine fascinating interactive artworks, translating these ideas into actual code remains challenging. This gap between imagination and execution reminds me that mastery comes only through continuous exploration and practice. What surprised me most was how this assignment became a journey through art history. Researching the Exquisite Corpse tradition connected me to the 20th Centuary Surrealist movement and its influence on modern art. It gave me a deeper understanding of the integration and innovation of the past and present.</p>
